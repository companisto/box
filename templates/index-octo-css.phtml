<p>OctoPrint started off as a fork of <a href="https://github.com/daid/Cura" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cura</a> by
<a href="https://github.com/daid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daid Braam</a>. Parts of its communication layer and
the server side GCODE interpreter are still based on Cura's code base from
December 2012 and hence on the work of its authors up until then.</p>

<h4>1.3.10 (2018-12-10)</h4>
<h5>Heads-up for plugin authors regarding the <code>sarge</code> dependency</h5>
<p>OctoPrint has updated its <code>sarge</code> dependency. The new version 0.1.5 has a small breaking change - the <code>async</code> keyword 
was renamed to <code>async_</code> for compatibility reasons with Python 3.7. This might also affect your plugin if you happen to 
use <code>sarge</code> somewhere therein. OctoPrint has a workaround for this in place so your plugin will continue to function for
now. However, you should look into updating it to use <code>async_</code> instead of <code>async</code> if running against OctoPrint 1.3.10+.</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://sarge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#id1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> for the <code>sarge</code> changelog.</p>

<li>Improve SD print detection</li>
<li>Added the Anonymous Usage Tracking Plugin. Tracking will only take place if the plugin is enabled and you’ve decided to opt-in during initial setup (or enabled it manually afterwards, through the corresponding switch in the settings). The tracking data will give insight into how OctoPrint is used, which versions are running and on what kind of hardware OctoPrint gets installed. You can learn about what will get tracked (if you opt-in) on <a href="https://tracking.octoprint.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tracking.octoprint.org</a>. Please consider helping development by participating in the anonymous usage tracking. </li>
<li>The OctoPi Support Plugin is now the Pi Support Plugin:<ul>
<li>Always enabled when running on a Raspberry Pi, regardless of whether OctoPi is used or not.</li>
<li>Now detects undervoltage/overheat issues and displays an alert on the UI if such an issue is found.</li>
<li>Changed detection method of the Raspberry Pi Model to something a bit more future proof.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added the Application Keys Plugin: The new bundled plugin offers an authorization for third party apps that doesn't involve manually copying API keys or using QR codes. Third party client developers are strongly advised to implement this workflow in their apps. Read more <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/bundledplugins/appkeys.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Added the Backup &amp; Restore Plugin: The new bundled plugin will allow you to make a backup of your OctoPrint settings, files and list of installed plugins, and to restore from such a backup on the
    same or another instance. This should make migration paths from outdated installations to newer ones easier.</li>
<li>Software Update Plugin: Automatic updates in outdated environments are no longer supported. After repeated issues out in the fields with ancient installations and ancient underlying Python environments, OctoPrint will no longer allow automatic updates of itself or plugins via the Software Update Plugin if a certain set of minimum versions of Python, <code>pip</code> and <code>setuptools</code> isn't detected. The current minimum versions reflect the environment found on OctoPi 0.14.0: Python 2.7.9, pip 9.0.1, setuptools 5.5.1. See also the <a href="https://faq.octoprint.org/unsupported-python-environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related FAQ entry</a>.</li>
<li>OctoPrint will now longer allow itself to be installed on Python versions less than 2.7.3 or higher than 2.7.x, to avoid peope running into issues in unsupported environments.</li>
<li>Protect/educate against the dangers of opening up OctoPrint on the public internet:<ul>
<li>Detect connections to the UI from external IPs and display a warning in such cases.</li>
<li>Added explicit warning to the first run wizard.</li>
<li>Added explicit warning to the documentation.</li>
<li>Added the ForcedLogin Plugin: Disables anonymous read-only access. To get back the old behaviour you'll have to explicitely disable this plugin.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed printed/visited layer counts from the GCODE viewer since it was confusing people more than helping them.</li>
<li>Added a warning to the documentation re expensive code in gcode hooks.  </li>
<li>Added the <code>no_firstrun_access</code> decorator.</li>
<li>Only disable autoscroll in the terminal when scrolling up, not when scrolling down.</li>
<li>Added a new asset type <code>clientjs</code> for JS client library components.</li>
<li>Added new options for the <code>showConfirmationDialog</code> UI helper:<ul>
<li><code>oncancel</code>: callback to call when the cancel button is pressed</li>
<li><code>noclose</code>: don't allow dismissing/closing the dialog without having chosen to proceed or cancel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow further access restrictions on API and Tornado routes by third party plugins.</li>
<li>Support using the JS client library with an unset API key.</li>
<li>Added documentation for <code>octoprint.util.commandline</code> module</li>
<li>More resilience against third party plugins that happily block or kill important startup threads</li>
<li>Improved backwards compatibility of the <code>sarge</code> dependency by monkey patching it to support the old <code>async</code> keyword parameter. Plugin authors are still advised to switch to the new <code>async_</code> parameter if running against <code>sarge&gt;=0.1.5</code>, unmodified plugins should continue to work now however. For reference, OctoPrint 1.3.10 requires <code>sarge==0.1.5post0</code>.</li>
<li>Better detection of ipv6 support by the underlying OS.</li>
<li>Updated several dependencies to current versions where possible.</li>
<li>Announcements Plugin: Add documentation.</li>
<li>Anonymous Usage Tracking: Added elapsed time &amp; reason of print failure to tracking (to be able to distinguish cancelled from errored out prints)</li>
<li>Anonymous Usage Tracking: Added undervoltage/overheat detection on Pis to tracking (to correlate print failures to power issues, see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2878</a>).</li>
<li>Backup: Exclude <code>generated</code>, <code>logs</code> and <code>watched</code> folders from backup</li>
<li>Backup: Use base version for version check on restore</li>
<li>Pi Support plugin: Better wording on the "undervoltage &amp; overheat" popover &amp; added a link to the FAQ entry</li>
<li>Printer Safety Plugin: Added Ender 3 stock firmware, Micro3D stock firmware and iME firmware to detection</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.3.9 (2018-07-25)</h4>
<h5>Still running OctoPrint 1.3.6? Heads-up!</h5>
<p>OctoPrint 1.3.9 includes a couple of dependency updates whose update during switch to 1.3.9 are known to trigger an "update failed" message within OctoPrint's update dialog:</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>[...]
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/pi/oprint/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/python_dateutil-2.6.0-py2.7.egg'
Successfully installed OctoPrint-1.3.9rc4 backports-abc-0.5 frozendict-1.2 markdown-2.6.11 pkginfo-1.4.2 pyserial-3.4 python-dateutil-2.6.1 singledispatch-3.4.0.3 tornado-4.5.3
The update did not finish successfully. Please consult the log for details.</p>
<p>``` </p>
<p>The update did in fact succeed and the issue lies with a change in the underlying update mechanism concerning the dependencies. This problem has been fixed in 1.3.7/1.3.8 and versions prior to 1.3.6 aren't yet affected, so there you won't ever see this message there. If you are still running 1.3.6 though and updating from it, <strong>simply run the update a second time through Settings &gt; Software Update &gt; Check for updates and clicking "Update now" in the reshown update notification</strong>.</p>
<h5>Running NGINX as reverse proxy? Be sure to configure HTTP protocol version 1.1!</h5>
<p>OctoPrint 1.3.9 updates the internal webserver Tornado from 4.0.2 to 4.5.3. Among many many fixes and improvements this also includes a change (actually a fix) in the websocket implementation that requires you to tell your NGINX to use HTTP 1.1 instead of the default 1.0 to talk to OctoPrint. You can do this by simply adding </p>
<p><code>proxy_http_version 1.1;</code></p>
<p>to the <code>location</code> config. The <a href="https://discourse.octoprint.org/t/reverse-proxy-configuration-examples/1107" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">configuration examples</a> have been adjusted accordingly. See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2526</a>.</p>
<h5>Disabled IPv6 and now there are issues with the server after the update? Bind to IPv4 addresses only!</h5>
<p>Starting with this release OctoPrint natively supports IPv6 and will attempt to bind to such addresses if it detects support in the underlying OS. If for whatever reason your OS doesn't support IPv6 even though Python's <code>socket</code> says otherwise, you can tell OctoPrint to bind to an IPv4 address only either via the <code>--host</code> command line parameter or <code>server.host</code> in <code>config.yaml</code>. Use <code>127.0.0.1</code> for localhost only, <code>0.0.0.0</code> for all IPv4 addresses or whatever specific IPv4 address you want to bind to.</p>
<h5>Plugin author and still dependent on the legacy plugin bundling flag? Fix your plugin!</h5>
<p>As <a href="https://octoprint.org/blog/2017/12/12/new-release-1.3.6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced with the release of OctoPrint 1.3.6</a>, the legacy plugin bundling flag has now been removed again. <a href="https://octoprint.org/blog/2017/12/01/heads-up-plugin-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Make sure to check and if necessary fix your plugins</a> if you haven't done that so far!</p>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#652</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1545</a> - Added name of user who started a job to job info (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2576</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1203</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1905</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1797</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2514</a> - Added support for plugins to override GCODE analysis provider and live print time estimation with their own implementations through two new hooks <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-filemanager-analysis-factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.filemanager.analysis.factory</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-printer-estimation-factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.printer.estimation.factory</code></a>. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1217</a> - Software Update Plugin: Block the UI in general when an update is in progress (even in browser windows that didn't start it and logged in as user) so that no prints can be accidentally started during that.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1513</a> - Option to allow sending <code>M0</code>/<code>M1</code> to the printer instead of swallowing it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2318</a> - Gcode Viewer: Visualize "current" print head location with a marker.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2351</a> - Support for binding to IPv6 addresses. OctoPrint will now default to binding to <code>::</code> if IPv6 support is detected, and to <code>0.0.0.0</code> if not. Both the intermediary server  and Tornado are instructed to bind their sockets to both IP versions. Positive IPv6 support detection relies on<ul>
<li><code>socket.has_ipv6</code> being <code>True</code></li>
<li><code>socket.IPPROTO_IPV6</code> and <code>socket.IPV6_V6ONLY</code> being available (or redefined in case of Windows) in order to ensure dual stack binding for the intermediary server)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2379</a> - File and plugin list now use the browser's native scrollbar instead of slimscroll. Slimscroll is still bundled though, in case third party plugins might depend on it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2487</a> - Improved documentation of system command configuration (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2498</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2495</a> - Removed unneeded filter from a template.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2498</a> - Improved documentation of the <code>async</code> flags of custom system commands.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2512</a> - Log files will now contain client IP as provided by first entry in X-Forwarded-For header (or more if <code>server.reverseProxy.trustDownstream</code> is configured accordingly).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2518</a> - Display absolute file upload date and time on hover (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2630</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2522</a> - Perform logging to disk asynchronously to avoid slow downs caused by it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2541</a> - Added link to instructions to reset passwords. Part of solving <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1239</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2543" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2543</a> - Added <code>--no-cache-dir</code> to pip calls to work around <code>MemoryErrors</code>. See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2535</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pypa/pip#2984</a> for more details.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2558</a> - Have the watched folder processor ignore hidden files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2572</a> - More error resilience in <code>ItemListHelper</code> against empty child elements.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2573" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2573</a> - Added <code>M118</code> to commands to never automatically upper case.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2583</a> - Handle scripts that are part of a job like other lines coming from a job and thus allow them to be kept back using <code>job_on_hold</code>.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2615</a> - Allowed more granular control over components to be upgraded through the software update plugin in its settings dialog.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2620</a> - Save <code>ItemListHelper</code> page sizes to local storage.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2642</a> - Added methods for adding and updating items to <code>ItemListHelper</code>.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2648</a> - Allowed class methods as callbacks in view models.</li>
<li>A new API endpoint <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/api/settings.html#fetch-template-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>/api/settings/templates</code></a> allows (admin only) access to information regarding the loaded templates and their order in the UI.

<li>Have the watched folder processor handle vanished files gracefully.</li>
<li>Removed <a href="https://octoprint.org/blog/2017/12/01/heads-up-plugin-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>legacyPluginAssets</code> flag</a>.</li>
<li>Improved requirement detection in <code>octoprint_setuptools</code>, added unit tests for that.</li>
<li>Bundled <code>sockjs-tornado</code> dependency. It hasn't been updated by the author in a while although there exist a number of issues plus patches for them, so we now vendor it.</li>
<li>Disabled position logging on cancel by default. If you need this, please explicitly enable it, it is causing too many issues in the field with misbehaving firmware.</li>
<li>Extended URL test API to allow whitelist/blacklist check for the returned content type, used that to verify that the webcam snapshot URL actually returns images.</li>
<li>Added timeout for position logging on pause/cancel. This should work around firmware which doesn't provide a proper <code>M114</code> resport that might be unparseable so we won't get stuck in those cases.</li>
<li>Migrated file storage metadata to json instead of YAML since it performs way way better.</li>
<li>Added <code>missing linenumber</code> to recognized non-fatal error messages.</li>
<li>Got rid of some Python 2 only code.</li>
<li>Added sanity checks for configured folders (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2644</a>):<ul>
<li>on startup: check they are writable, if not revert to defaults</li>
<li>on settings save: check they are writable, if not return an HTTP 400</li>
<li>in the settings dialog: allow quick check of writability via test buttons</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Never send referrers with links</li>
<li>Confirmation dialog helper now supports an HTML body.</li>
<li>Sort serial ports naturally (e.g. <code>tty1</code>, <code>tty2</code>, ..., <code>tty10</code> instead of <code>tty1</code>, <code>tty10</code>, ...)</li>
<li>Added <code>paused</code> and <code>resumed</code> action commands, <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/features/action_commands.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see here for details</a>.</li>
<li>Added two new hooks for firmware information, <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-comm-firmware-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.comm.firmware.info</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-comm-firmware-capabilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.comm.firmware.capabilities</code></a>.</li>
<li>Added view model list to <code>OctoPrint.coreui</code> UI module.</li>
<li>Improved logging of <code>FatalStartupError</code>s.</li>
<li>Add sanity check for disabled plugin list (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2687#issuecomment-399797596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2687 (comment)</a>).</li>
<li>Improve logging of exceptions triggered inside the state update worker (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2715" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2715</a>).</li>
<li>Workaround for a potential <code>pip</code> issue when updating components through the Software Update plugin.</li>
<li>Fix resend and timeout handling during an active <code>job_on_hold</code>.</li>
<li>Updated some dependencies:<ul>
<li>Tornado to 4.5. Version 5 sadly has issues with web socket handling when access behind <code>haproxy</code>. So far no solution has been found, so we stay at 4.5 for now.</li>
<li>jQuery to 3.3.1</li>
<li>Several other Python dependencies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Announcement Plugin: Don't reload all notifications if one is marked as read.</li>
<li>Printer Safety Plugin: Added new detected firmwares:<ul>
<li>Anycubic Mega</li>
<li>Malyan M200</li>
<li>CR-10S</li>
<li>all Repetier firmware versions prior to 0.92</li>
<li>any firmware that reports the <code>THERMAL_PROTECTION</code> capability as disabled to thermal protection warning (see also <a href="https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/pull/10465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MarlinFirmware/Marlin#10465</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#324</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2414</a> - Native support for the following <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/features/atcommands.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@ commands</a>: <code>@pause</code> (pauses the print), <code>@resume</code> (resumes the print), <code>@cancel</code> or <code>@abort</code> (cancels the print). More commands can be added through the plugin hooks <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-comm-protocol-atcommand-phase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.comm.protocol.atcommand.*</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1951</a> - Fixed plugins being able to modify internal state data (e.g. progress, job), causing concurrent modification and resulting run time errors in the printer state processing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2208</a> - New plugin hook <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-comm-protocol-gcode-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.comm.protocol.gcode.error</code></a> to allow plugins to override OctoPrint's handling of <code>Error:</code>/<code>!!</code> messages reported by the firmware. Can be used to "downgrade" errors that aren't actually fatal errors that make the printer halt.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2213</a> - Made sure to prevent accidental configuration of a temperature cutoff value less than 1min for the temperature graph.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2250</a> - Added <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/modules/util.html#octoprint.util.ResettableTimer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.util.ResettableTimer</code></a> helper class.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2287</a> - Added confirmation for attempting to disconnect during an ongoing print.

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2317</a> - Removed capturing of post roll images for time based timelapses, was causing too much confusion and surprise.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2335</a> - First throw at detecting if a print from the printer's SD was started outside of OctoPrint via the printer's control panel. Requires some specific requirements to be fulfilled by the printer's firmware to function properly:<ul>
<li>Firmware must send a "File opened: ..." message on start of the print</li>
<li>Firmware must respond to an immediately sent <code>M27</code> with <code>SD printing byte &lt;current&gt;/&lt;total&gt;</code></li>
<li>Firmware must stay responsive during ongoing print to allow for regular M27 polls (or push those automatically) or M25 to pause/cancel the print through OctoPrint.</li>
<li>Firmware must send <code>Done printing file</code> or respond to <code>M27</code> with <code>Not SD printing</code> when SD printing finishes (either due to being done or to having been cancelled by the user).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2362" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2362</a> - Added option to configure timelapse snapshot timeout.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2385</a> - Made valid boolean trues check case insensitive.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2304</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2405</a> - Added support to trust Basic Authentication headers for user login. Currently requires <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">manual configuration through <code>config.yaml</code></a>, see the <code>accessControl.trustBasicAuthentication</code> and <code>accessControl.checkBasicAuthenticationPassword</code> settings.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2338</a> - Allowed plugins to define GCODE script variables using the <code>octoprint.comm.protocol.scripts</code> hook.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2406</a> - Extracted log management into its own bundled plugin and allow fine tuning of log levels.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2409</a> - Added <code>m4v</code> and <code>mkv</code> to the list of accepted timelapse extensions.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2444</a> - Support additional CSS classes on custom control buttons.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2448</a> - Also detect plugins in <code>~/.octoprint/plugins</code> that are provided as bytecode <code>pyc</code> instead of source <code>py</code> files.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2455</a> - Added option to configure SSL validation for snapshot URL.</li>
<li>Support <code>M114</code> response format of RepRapFirmware (uses <code>X:... Y:... Z:... E0:... E1:...</code> instead of
<code>X:... Y:... Z:... E:...</code>)</li>
<li>Added refresh button to connection panel for easy refresh of the available ports to connect to without having to reload the whole page.</li>
<li>Increased upper bound of PySerial dependency from 2.7 to 3.4. See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2333</a>.</li>
<li>Switch to lower communication timeouts if support of the <code>busy</code> protocol by the firmware is detected.</li>
<li>Refactored serial settings dialog, now has sub tabs and more explanations.</li>
<li>Allow to disable support for certain firmware capabilities, even if reported as supported by the firmware: <code>busy</code> protocol, temperature auto reporting, SD status auto reporting</li>
<li>Attached tags to GCODE commands moving through the comm layer and allowed plugins to access and extend these tags through the GCODE hooks. Makes it possible for plugins to detect the origin of a command (streamed file vs. GCODE script vs. user input vs. plugin), the point where it entered the system and so on. Also added a new logger <code>octoprint.util.comm.command_phases</code> that if set to <code>DEBUG</code> will log the lifecycle of commands through the comm layer including tags to <code>octoprint.log</code>. See also <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-comm-protocol-gcode-phase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the docs here</a>.</li>
<li>Added new <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/modules/printer.html#octoprint.printer.PrinterInterface.job_on_hold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>job_on_hold</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/modules/printer.html#octoprint.printer.PrinterInterface.set_job_on_hold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>set_job_on_hold</code></a> methods on the printer instance, allowing plugins to quickly stall the streaming of a queue. This should be used sparingly - abuse will have significant negative effects on the print job. Read the docs if you plan to utilize this.</li>
<li>Support extraction of plugin metadata even from disabled and blacklisted plugins through the AST of the module.</li>
<li>Better logging of printer callback errors and utilization of <code>frozendict</code> for internal printer state propagation in an attempt to narrow down on <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1951</a>. Should <code>frozendict</code> cause issues it can be disabled through the settings in <code>config.yaml</code>, just set <code>devel.useFrozenDictForPrinterState</code> to <code>false</code> </li>
<li>Log comm state changes to <code>octoprint.log</code>.</li>
<li>Added a regular server heartbeat to the log (every 15min).</li>
<li>Support SD status auto report by the firmware.</li>
<li>Added <code>Not SD printing</code> to default "SD status" terminal filters.</li>
<li>Added custom <code>readline</code> implementation for the serial port. Instead of relying on PySerial's <code>readline</code> that depending on the installed version might only read from the port one byte at the time, we now wait for one byte and then read everything available into a persistent buffer which then is used to fetch lines from. </li>
<li>Ensure that <code>callViewModelIf</code> doesn't try to call null or uncallable <code>method</code>s.</li>
<li>Added links to the new <a href="https://discourse.octoprint.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Forum</a> and the new location of the <a href="https://faq.octoprint.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ</a>.</li>
<li>Improved pip utility logging, <code>LocalPipHelper</code> wasn't producing output, making it hard to debug such non writable install directories.</li>
<li>Added a new bundled plugin "Printer Safety Check" that will try to identify printer/printer firmware with known safety issues such as missing thermal runaway protection.</li>
<li>Plugin Manager: Reduce notification spam. See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2260</a>.</li>
<li>Software Update Plugin: Better detection if an update is already running.</li>
<li>Software Update Plugin: Refer to <code>plugin_softwareupdate_console.log</code> on update errors in log and notification.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.3.6 (2017-12-12)</h4>
<h5>Note for upgraders and plugin authors: Change in the bundling of JS assets can lead to issues in plugins</h5>
<p>A change to solve issues with plugins bundling JS assets that cause interference with other plugins (e.g. through the declaration of <code>"use strict"</code>) and in general to add better isolation and error handling might cause errors for some plugins that go beyond your run-off-the-mill view model and also implicitly declare new globals.</p>
<p>If you happen to run into any such issues, you can switch back to the old way of bundling JS assets via the newly introduced "Settings &gt; Feature &gt; Enable legacy plugin asset bundling" toggle (check it, save the settings, restart the server). This is provided to allow for a minimally invasive adjustment period until affected plugins have been updated.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the change, how to know if a plugin is even affected and what do about it <a href="https://octoprint.org/blog/2017/12/01/heads-up-plugin-authors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the OctoBlog</a>.</p>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#203</a> - Allow selecting the current tab via URL hashs. Also update URL hash when switching tabs, thus adding this to the browser history and allowing quicker back and forth navigation through the browser's back and forward buttons.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1026</a> - Automatically upper case parameters in GCODE commands sent from the Terminal tab. A black list is in place that prevent upper casing of parameters for GCODE commands where it doesn't make sense (default: <code>M117</code>). See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2177</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2050</a> - New hook <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-comm-protocol-temperatures-received" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.comm.protocol.temperatures.received</code></a> that allows plugins to further preprocess/sanitize temperature data received from the printer. </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2055</a> - Increased the size of the API key field in the settings.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2056</a> - Added a Copy button to the API key field in the settings and user settings.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2094</a> - Allow UTF-8 display names for uploaded files. The files will still get an ASCII only name on disk, but the UTF-8 name used during upload will also be persisted and shown in the file list. This also allows using emojis in your file and folder names now.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2104</a> - Allow more URL schemes for installing plugins from. Supported schemes should now mirror what <code>pip</code> itself supports: <code>http</code>, <code>https</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>git+http</code>, <code>git+https</code>, <code>git+ssh</code>, <code>git+git</code>, <code>hg+http</code>, <code>hg+https</code>, <code>hg+static-http</code>, <code>hg+ssh</code>, <code>svn</code>, <code>svn+svn</code>, <code>svn+http</code>, <code>svn+https</code>, <code>svn+ssh</code>, <code>bzr+http</code>, <code>bzr+https</code>, <code>bzr+ssh</code>, <code>bzr+sftp</code>, <code>bzr+ftp</code>, <code>bzr+lp</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2109</a> - New decorator <code>@firstrun_only_access</code> for API endpoints that should only be available before first setup has been completed.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2111</a> - Made the file list's scroll bar wider.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2131</a> - Added warning to restart, shutdown, reboot and update confirmations that that may disrupt ongoing prints, even those run from the printer's internal storage/SD. See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2146</a> and <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2152</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2138</a> - Slightly longer timeout when attempting to read from serial during auto detection via programming mode. Might help with detection of some slower printer controllers under certain circumstances.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2200</a> - Wrap all JS assets of plugins into one anonymous function per plugin. That way plugins using <code>"use strict";</code> won't cause hard to debug and weird issues with other plugins bundled after them. The down side is that plugins currently relying on implicit declaration of global helper functions or variables (<code>function convert(value) { ... }</code>) to be available outside of their own plugin's JS assets will now run into errors. To compensate for that while affected plugins are adjusted to declare globals explicitly (<code>window.convert = function(value) { ... }</code>), a temporary feature flag was added as "Settings &gt; Features &gt; Enable legacy plugin asset bundling" that switches back to the old form of bundling until plugins you rely on are updated. This flag will be removed again in a later version (currently planned for 1.3.8). See also the note above and <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2246</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2229</a> - Added note to printer profile dialog that the nozzle offsets for multi extruder setups are only to be configured if they are not already set in the printer's firmware.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2232</a> - Disable movement distance buttons when not connected to the printer or when printing, since they don't have any use then.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2239" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2239</a> - Improved the check summing speed, thus improving the general achievable throughput on the comm layer.</li>
<li>Allow cancelling of file transfers</li>
<li>Made check of how old an unrendered timelapse is more lenient buy looking at both the creation and last modification date and using the younger one.</li>
<li>Made notifications in general auto-close faster.</li>
<li>Make the first profile saved for a slicer the default profile for that slicer.</li>
<li>New command <code>server</code> for testing server connections on the <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/api/util.html#post--api-util-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JS test API</a>.</li>
<li>New hook <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/plugins/hooks.html#octoprint-accesscontrol-keyvalidator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>octoprint.accesscontrol.keyvalidator</code></a> that allows plugins to validate their own customized API keys to be used to access OctoPrint.</li>
<li>Updated <code>cookiecutter</code>, <code>requests</code> and <code>psutil</code> dependencies.</li>
<li>Added safety warning to first run wizard. </li>
<li>More error resilience against broken view models.</li>
<li>New sub command <code>octoprint safemode</code>. Will set the <code>server.startOnceInSafeMode</code> setting in the config so that the next (re)start of the server after issuing this command will happen in safe mode.</li>
<li>New sub command <code>octoprint config effective</code>. Will report the effective config.</li>
<li>New centralized plugin blacklist (opt-in). Allows to prevent plugins/certain versions of plugins known to cause crippling issues with the normal operation of OctoPrint to be disabled from loading, if the user has opted to do so in the settings/wizard.</li>
<li>Log how to enable <code>serial.log</code> to <code>serial.log</code> if it's disabled. That will hopefully put at least a small dent in the amount of "It's empty!" responses in tickets ;)</li>
<li>Force new Pypi index URL in <code>requirements.txt</code> as an additional work around against old tooling.</li>
<li>Prefer plain <code>pip</code> over <code>git</code> for updating OctoPrint.</li>
<li>Added environment detection and logging on startup. That should give us more information about the environment to produce a reported bug in.</li>
<li>Added OctoPi support plugin that provides information about the detected OctoPi version. Will only load if OctoPi is detected.</li>
<li>More dynamic plugin mixin detection. Now using a base class instead of having to list all types manually. Should greatly reduce overhead of adding new mixin types.</li>
<li>Support leaf merging for file extension tree, allowing to add new file extensions to types registered by default.</li>
<li>Allow non GCODE SD file transfers if registered as <code>machinecode</code> through e.g. a plugin's file extension hook. Caution: This doesn't make streaming arbitrary files to the printer via serial work magically. It merely allows that, it's up to the firmware to actually be able to handle that. Also, the regular GCODE streaming protocol is used, so if the streamed file contains control characters from that (e.g. <code>M29</code> to signal the end of the streaming process), stuff will break!</li>
<li>Added a test button for the online connectivity check.</li>
<li>Announcements plugin: Added UTM Tags.</li>
<li>Cura plugin: Less <code>not configured yet</code> logging.</li>
<li>GCODE viewer: Added advanced options that allow configuring display of bounding boxes, sorting by layers and hiding of empty layers.</li>
<li>GCODE viewer: Persist all options to local storage so they will be automatically set again the next time the GCODE viewer is used in the same browser.</li>
<li>Software update: Auto-hide "Everything is up-to-date" notification.</li>
<li>Easier copying of terminal contents thanks to dedicated copy button.</li>
<li>Timelapse: <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2067</a> - Added rate limiting to z-based timelapse capturing to prevent issues when accidentally leaving this mode on with vase mode prints.</li>
<li>Timelapse: Refactored configuration form &amp; added reset button to switch back to currently active settings.</li>
<li>Timelapse: Sort timelapses by modification instead of creation time (creation time can be newer if a backup restore was done).</li>
<li>Virtual printer: Support configurable ambient temperature for testing.</li>
<li>Virtual printer: Support configurable reset lines.</li>
<li>Virtual printer: Added new debug trigger <code>trigger_missing_lineno</code>.</li>
<li>Virtual printer: Allow empty/<code>None</code> prepared oks, allowing to simulate lost acknowledgements right on start.</li>
<li>Docs: <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2142</a> - Added documentation for the bundled virtual printer plugin.</li>
<li>Docs: <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2234</a> - Added info on how to install under Suse Linux.</li>
<li>Docs: Added example PyCharm run configuration that includes automatic dependency updates on start.</li>
<li>Docs: Added information on how to run the test suite.</li>
<li>Various refactorings</li>
<li>Various documentation updates</li>
<li>Fetch plugin blacklist (and also announcements, plugin notices and plugin repository) via https instead of http.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.3.5 (2017-10-16)</h4>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1162</a> - Allow <code>octoprint.comm.protocol.gcode.queuing</code> hook to return a list of commands.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1572" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1572</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1881</a> - Refactored web interface startup process to minimise risk of race conditions and speed improvements. Also added sequence diagram to the documentation showing the new processing order.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1640</a> - Mouse over temperature graph to get exact data for that time.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1679</a> - Support temperature autoreporting by the firmware instead of polling if the firmware reports to support it. For this to work with Marlin 1.1.0 to 1.1.3 you'll need to explicitly enable <code>EXTENDED_CAPABILITIES_REPORT</code> <em>and</em> <code>AUTO_REPORT_TEMPERATURES</code> in your firmware configuration, otherwise your firmware won't report that it actually supports this feature.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1737</a> - Auto-detect Anet A8 firmware and treat as Repetier Firmware (which it actually appears to be, just renamed - thanks Anet for making this even harder). </li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1842</a> - Update bundled FontAwesome to 4.7 (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1915</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1910</a> - Make last/pause/cancel temperature available for GCODE scripts.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1925</a> - Include configured webcam stream URL in "Webcam stream not loaded" message for logged in users/admins. Slightly different wording for guests vs users vs admins.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1941</a> - Enable "block while dwelling" flag when Malyan firmware is detected since that firmware seems to handle <code>G4</code> identically to Repetier Firmware instead of Marlin (like it claims to). See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1762</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1946</a> - Add option to disable position logging on cancel/pause. See "Log position on cancel" and "Log position on pause" under Settings &gt; Serial &gt; Advanced options.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1971</a> - Refactored temperature inputs. They now sport some fancy +/- buttons to increment/decrement the current temperature (which also auto submit after a couple of seconds) and easier editing by keyboard. The temperature offset was also slightly redesigned to make room for that.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1975</a> - Better error reporting when deleting timelapses.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2010</a> - Slight refactoring in the terminal tab: Full width input field, auto focus of input field when just clicking on terminal output.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2011</a> - Centralized online connectivity check (with opt-in of course). None of the bundled plugins will attempt to fetch data from the net when the connectivity check indicates that would fail anyhow. This should improve server startup times and various requests when running isolated.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2025</a> - More verbose logging of asynchronous system commands (e.g. restart/shutdown).</li>
<li>Allow timelapse configuration through UI even when not connected to the printer (suggested in <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1918</a>)</li>
<li>Disable "Upload to SD" UI elements while printing (suggested in <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1914</a>)</li>
<li>Update bundled SockJS to 1.1.2 incl. source maps</li>
<li>Set <code>X-Robots</code> HTTP header and remove <code>Server</code> header from all responses, also set <code>robots</code> meta tag in page.</li>
<li>Don't require to enter programmer mode for printer port autodetection when there's only one possible port candidate anyhow.</li>
<li>More sensible sorting of baudrates (additionally configured, then 115200, then 250000, then everything else).</li>
<li>Don't show "Unhandled communication error" on autodetection failure.</li>
<li>Make timeout after which to unload the webcam stream after navigating away from it configurable (as suggested in <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1937</a>)</li>
<li>Add <code>ToolChange</code> event and tool change GCODE scripts</li>
<li>Support parsing GCODE subcodes.</li>
<li>Add <code>octoprint.users.factory</code> hook, allowing plugins to extend/swap out the user manager OctoPrint uses.</li>
<li>Corewizard: Disable view model and client code if it's not actually required.</li>
<li>Corewizard: Disable injection of JS files into UI when it's not actually required.</li>
<li>GCODE analysis: Moved into its own subprocess. That should improve performance on multi core systems.</li>
<li>GCODE viewer: Ignore coordinates outside bed when zooming/centering on model. Those usually are nozzle priming routines.</li>
<li>JS Client Lib: Add centralized browser detection as <code>OctoPrint.coreui.browser</code>. Available properties: <code>chrome</code>, <code>firefox</code>, <code>safari</code>, <code>ie</code>, <code>edge</code>, <code>opera</code> as well as <code>mobile</code> and <code>desktop</code>, all of which are boolean values.</li>
<li>Plugin Manager plugin: Detect if a plugin requires a reconnect to the printer to become fully active/inactive.</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: Force exact version when updating OctoPrint and tracking releases.</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: "Devel RCs" release channel now also tracks maintenance RCs. That way people don't have to toggle between the two any more to get <em>all</em> RCs.</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: <code>bitbucket_commit</code> check type now supports API credentials (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1993</a>).</li>
<li>Wizard: Allow suppressing the "the settings got updated" dialog through subwizards, in case they need to update settings asynchronously as part of their workflow.</li>
<li>More resilience against expected folders being files.</li>
<li>More resilience against a wrong user manager class being configured.</li>
<li>Some code refactoring &amp; cleanup.</li>
<li>Some HTML &amp; CSS improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Bug fixes</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1916</a> - Fix webcam not loading if first/initial tab is "Control"</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1943</a> - Fix issue causing unnecessary creation of default printer profile on startup</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1946</a> - Decouple writing of print log from everything else. Fixes delay in cancel processing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1963</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1974</a> - Allow empty &amp; custom size in print job events. Also fixes an issue with timelapses when printing from SD on printers that require the GPX plugin to work.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1996</a> - Support all line ending variantes in the GCODE viewer. Solves an issue with GCODE generated for Prusa's multi material extruder since that uses only <code>\r</code> for some reason.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2007</a> - Fix issue parsing temperature lines from the printer that contain negative values.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2012</a> - Fix command line interface of Software Update plugin.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2017</a> - Fix issue in GCODE viewer with files that contain a visit to the first layer twice (e.g. brim, then nose dive from higher z for actual model), causing all but the last layer segment to not be rendered.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2033</a> (regression) - Temperature tab: Fix for legend in graph not updating with current values on mouse over.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2033</a> (regression) - Temperature tab: Fix for new temperature inputs not fitting on one line in Firefox.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2033</a> (regression) - Temperature tab &amp; GCODE viewer: Fix for available tools (and offsets) not properly updating on change of printer profile.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2033</a> (regression) - Wizard: Fix sorting of required wizards not properly handling non-ASCII unicode.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2035</a> (regression) - Fix an issue of the server not starting up if there's a file in the analysis backlog. The reason for this is that spawning a new process while the intermediary server is active causes the server port to be blocked (this is due to how subprocessing works by default), in turn leading to an error on startup since the port cannot be bound by the actual server. Since the GCODE analysis takes now place in its own subprocess and hence triggers this problem, it had to be moved until after the actual server has already started up to avoid this problem.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2059</a> (regression) - Fix an issue causing the new temperature controls to wrap on touch enabled devices when the temperature dropdown is opened.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2090</a> (regression) - Fix an issue causing an aborted server startup under Windows if the timing is just right.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2135</a> (regression) - Fix an issue causing import errors inside the GCODE analysis tool in certain environments due to <code>sys.path</code> entries causing relative imports.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2136</a> (regression) - Fix wrong minimum version for <code>sockjs-tornado</code> dependency.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2137</a> (regression) - Fix issue with session cookies getting lost when running an OctoPrint instance on a subpath of another (e.g. <code>octopi.local/</code> and <code>octopi.local/octoprint2</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#2140</a> (regression) - Fix issue with locale dependent sorting of sub wizards during first time setup causing issues leading to the wizard not being able to complete.</li>
<li>Fix various popup buttons allowing multiple clicks (suggested in <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1914</a>)</li>
<li>Software Update Plugin: Perform server restart asynchronously. Should reduce restart times on updates significantly.</li>
<li>Don't hex-escape <code>\t</code>, <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> in terminal output</li>
<li>Use client side default printer profile if the default profile could not be found on the server</li>
<li>Use both "to" and "from" coordinates of a given move for min/max model coordinate calculation in GCODE analysis. Otherwise wrong values could be calculated under certain circumstances.  </li>
<li>Fix potential race condition in resend request handling.</li>
<li>Fix potential race condition in web socket handling.</li>
<li>Fix handling of tool offsets in GCODE analysis - diverted too far from firmware implementations, causing wrong calculations.</li>

<li>Fix potential division by zero in progress reporting if the timing was just right.</li>
<li>Fix sorting order for multiple tools in the "State" panel.</li>
<li>Fix file position vs. line ending handling in GCODE viewer. Could lead to slightly off file position calculation and hence possibly to the wrong move being plotted when synchronizing with print progress.</li>
<li>Wizard: Fix <code>onWizardPreventSettingsRefreshDialog</code> callback invocation. (regression)</li>
<li>Corewizard plugin: Fix <code>firstrunonly</code> wizards (e.g. for printer profile configuration) being displayed again if <em>any</em> of the sub wizards (e.g. for the online check opt-in and configuration) is active. (regression)</li>
<li>Fix an issue causing rollover of <code>serial.log</code> to fail under Windows. (regression)</li>

<h4>1.3.4 (2017-06-01)</h4>
<h5>Note for owners of Malyan M200/Monoprice Select Mini</h5>
<p>OctoPrint's firmware autodetection is now able to detect this printer. Currently when this printer is detected, the following firmware specific features will be enabled automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always assume SD card is present (<code>feature.sdAlwaysAvailable</code>)</li>
<li>Send a checksum with the command: Always (<code>feature.alwaysSendChecksum</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the firmware is a very special kind of beast and its sources are so far unavailable, only tests with a real printer will show if those are sufficient settings for communication with this printer to fully function correctly. Thus, if you run into any issues with enabled firmware autodetection on this printer model, please add a comment in <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1762</a> and explain what kind of communication problem you are seeing.

<h4>1.3.2 (2017-03-16)</h4>
<h5>Note for plugin authors</h5>
<p><strong>If you maintain a plugin that extends OctoPrint's <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/jsclientlib/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript Client Library</a></strong> like demonstrated in e.g. the bundled Software Update Plugin you'll need to update the way you register your plugin to depend on <code>OctoPrintClient</code> and registering your extension as shown <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/6e793c2/src/octoprint/plugins/softwareupdate/static/js/softwareupdate.js#L1-L84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> instead of directly writing to <code>OctoPrint.plugins</code> (like it was still done <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/23744cd/src/octoprint/plugins/softwareupdate/static/js/softwareupdate.js#L1-L81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>). That way your extensions will be available on all instances of <code>OctoPrintClient</code>, not just the global instance <code>OctoPrint</code> that gets created on startup of the core web interface.</p>
<p>If all you plugin does with regards to JavaScript is registering a custom view model and you have no idea what I'm talking about regarding extending the client library, no action is necessary. This heads-up is really only relevant if you extended the JavaScript Client Library.</p>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#732</a> - Have OctoPrint's <code>python setup.py clean</code> build on stock
<code>python setup.py clean</code> for better compatibility with packaging systems</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1506</a> - Better handle really long "dwell"/<code>G4</code> commands on Repetier firmware (as for example apparently recommended to use with Wanhao D6 and similar printers for nozzle cooling) by actively stalling communication from OctoPrint's side as well. That way we no longer run into a communication timeout produced by a 5min dwell immediately happily acknowledged by the printer with an <code>ok</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1542</a> - Support for multi-extruder setups with a shared single nozzle and heater (e.g. E3D Cyclops, Diamond hotend, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1676</a> - Trigger line number reset when connected to printer and seeing <code>start</code> message. This should fix issues with printer communication when printer resets but reset goes otherwise undetected.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1681" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1681</a> - Support for connecting to multiple OctoPrint instances via the <a href="http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/jsclientlib/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JavaScript Client Library</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1712</a> - Display current folder name in file list if in sub folder.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1723</a> - Ignore leading <code>v</code> or <code>V</code> on plugin version numbers for version checks in plugin manager and software updater (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1724</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1770</a> - Better resilience against null bytes received from the printer for whatever reason.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1770</a> - Detect printer as connected even when only receiving a <code>wait</code> instead of <code>ok</code>. Should solve issues with initial connect where printer sends garbage over the line that eats/covers the <code>ok</code> if printer also sends regular <code>wait</code> messages when idle.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1780</a> - Work around for Safari re-opening one copy of the webcam stream after the other and eating up bandwidth unnecessarily (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1786</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1790</a> - Removed unused "color" property from printer profile editor.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1805</a> - Better error resilience against invalid print history data from plugins that replace the printer communication.</li>
<li>Better error resilience in Plugin Manager against wonky version data in repository file.</li>
<li>Added a "Restart in safe mode" system menu entry that will always be available if the restart command is configured</li>
<li>CLI: Only offer <code>daemon</code> sub command on Linux (since that it's the only OS it works on)</li>
<li>Less throttling of analysis of GCODE files from the analysis backlog. Should still leave Pi and friends air to breathe but allow a slightly faster processing of the backlog.</li>
<li>Added an explanation of safe mode to the docs.</li>
<li>Log OctoPrint version &amp; plugin list when detecting log rollover.</li>
<li>Allow <code>UiPlugin</code>s to define additional fields for ETag generation.</li>
<li>Allow <code>UiPlugin</code>s utilizing OctoPrint's stock templates to filter out what they don't need.</li>
<li>Locales contained in <code>translations</code> of plugins will now be registered with the system. That way it's possible to provide translations for the full application through plugins.</li>
<li>Abort file analysis if file is about to be overwritten</li>
<li>Software Update Plugin: Refresh cache on startup, prevent concurrent refresh</li>
<li>More solid parsing of request line number for resend requests. Should improve compatibility with Teacup firmwares. Based on issue reported via PR <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/300" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#300</a></li>
</ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1317</a> - Fixed a color distortion issue when rendering timelapses from higher resolution source snapshots that also need to be rotated by adjusting <code>ffmpeg</code> parameters to avoid an unexpected behaviour when a pixel format and a filter chain are required for processing.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1560</a> - Make sure we don't try to use an empty <code>logging.yaml</code></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1631</a> - Disable "Slice" button in slice dialog if a print is ongoing and a slicer is selected that runs on the same device as OctoPrint. The server would already deny such requests (simply due to performance reasons), but the UI didn't properly reflect that yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1671</a> - Removed "Hide empty folders" option from file list. Didn't really add value and caused usability issues.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1765</a> - Fixed watched folder not waiting with file move until file stopped growing, causing wrong progress percentages to be reported.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1777</a> - Fixed z-change based timelapses with Slic3r generated z-hops not properly triggering snapshots.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1792</a> - Don't tell Safari we are "web-app-capable" because that means it will throw away all cookies and the user will have to constantly log in again when using a desktop shortcut for the OctoPrint instance.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1812</a> - Don't scroll up navigation in settings when switching between settings screens, very annoying on smaller resolutions (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1814</a>)</li>
<li>Fix settings helper not allowing to delete values for keys that are present in the local config but not in the defaults.</li>

<h4>1.3.1 (2017-01-25)</h4>
<h5>Note for upgraders</h5>
<h6>If you installed OctoPrint manually and used the included init script, you need to update that</h6>
<p>The init script so far shipped with OctoPrint contained a <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bug</a> that causes issues with OctoPrint 1.3.0 and higher. Please update your init script to the fixed version OctoPrint now ships under <code>scripts</code>:</p>
<p><code>sudo cp /path/to/OctoPrint/scripts/octoprint.init /etc/init.d/octoprint</code></p>
<p>If you are running OctoPi, this does <strong>not</strong> apply to you and you do not need to do anything here!</p>
<h6>Change in stock terminal filter configuration</h6>
<p>1.3.1 fixes an issue with the two terminal filters for suppressing temperature and SD status messages and adds a new filter for filtering out firmware <code>wait</code> messages. These changes will only be active automatically though for stock terminal filter configurations. If you have customized your terminal filters, you'll need to apply these changes manually under "Settings &gt; Terminal filters":
- Changed "Suppress temperature messages" filter, new regex is <code>(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M105)|(Recv: ok (B|T\d*):)</code>
- Changed "Suppress SD status messages" filter, new regex is <code>(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M27)|(Recv: SD printing byte)</code>
- New "Suppress wait responses" filter, regex is <code>Recv: wait</code></p>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1607</a> - Way better support for password managers (e.g. browser built-in, 1Password, Lastpass, Dashlane)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1638</a> - Make confirmation dialog when cancelling a print optional.</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1705</a> - Simplified install process on Mac by removing dependency on pyobjc.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1706</a> - Added a mask icon for Safari pinned tab and touchbar.</li>
<li>Support extraction of filament diameter for volume calculation from GCODE files sliced through Simplify3D.</li>
<li>Abort low priority jobs in the file analysis queue when a high priority job comes in - should make file analysis and hence time estimates show up faster for newly uploaded files.</li>
<li>Added a terminal filter for firmware <code>wait</code> messages to the stock terminal filters. If you did modify your terminal filter configuration, you might want to add this manually:</li>
<li>New "Suppress wait responses" filter: <code>Recv: wait</code></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>1.3.0 (2016-12-08)</h4>
<h5>Features</h5>
<ul>
<li>You can now create folders in the file list, upload files into said folders and thus better manage your projects' files.</li>
<li>New wizard dialog for system setups that can also be extended by plugins. Replaces the first run dialog for setting up access control and can also be triggered in other cases than only the first run, e.g. if plugins necessitate user input to function properly. Added wizards to help configuring the following components in OctoPrint on first run: access control, webcam URLs &amp; ffmpeg path, server commands (restart, shutdown, reboot), printer profile. Also extended the bundled Cura plugin to add a wizard for its first setup to adjust path and import a slicing profile, and the bundled Software Update plugin to ask the user for details regarding the OctoPrint update configuration. Also see below.</li>
<li>New command line interface (CLI). Offers the same functionality as the old one plus:<ul>
<li>a built-in API client (<code>octoprint client --help</code>)</li>
<li>built-in development tools (<code>octoprint dev --help</code>)</li>
<li>extendable through plugins implementing the <code>octoprint.cli.commands</code> hook (<code>octoprint plugins --help</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New features within the plugin system:<ul>
<li>Plugins may now give hints in which order various hooks or mixin methods should be called by optionally providing an integer value that will be used for sorting the callbacks prior to execution.</li>
<li>Plugins may now define configuration overlays to be applied on top of the default configuration but before <code>config.yaml</code>.</li>
<li>New mixin <code>UiPlugin</code> for plugins that want to provide an alternative web interface delivered by the     server.</li>
<li>New mixin <code>WizardPlugin</code> for plugins that want to provide wizard components to OctoPrint's new wizard dialog.</li>
<li>New hook <code>octoprint.cli.commands</code> for registering a command with the new OctoPrint CLI</li>
<li>New hook <code>octoprint.comm.protocol.gcode.received</code> for receiving messages from the printer</li>
<li>New hook <code>octoprint.printer.factory</code> for providing a custom factory to contruct the global <code>PrinterInterface</code> implementation.</li>
<li>New <code>TemplatePlugin</code> template type: <code>wizard</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>New Javascript client library for utilizing the server's API, can be reused by <code>UiPlugin</code>s.</li>
<li>OctoPrint will now track the current print head position on pause and cancel and provide it as new template variables <code>pause_position</code>/<code>cancel_position</code> for the relevant GCODE scripts. This will allow more intelligent pause codes that park the print head at a rest position during pause and move it back to the exact position it was before the pause on resume (<a href="https://gist.github.com/foosel/1c09e269b1c0bb7a471c20eef50c8d3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Example</a>). Note that this is NOT enabled by default and for now will necessitate adjusting the pause and resume GCODE scripts yourself since position tracking with multiple extruders or when printing from SD is currently not fool proof thanks to firmware limitations regarding reliable tracking of the various <code>E</code> values and the currently selected tool <code>T</code>. In order to fully implement this feature, the following improvements were also done:<ul>
<li>New <code>PositionUpdated</code> event when OctoPrint receives a response to an <code>M114</code> position query.</li>
<li>Extended <code>PrintPaused</code> and <code>PrintCancelled</code> events with position data from <code>M114</code> position query on print interruption/end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added (optional) firmware auto detection. If enabled (which it is by default), OctoPrint will now send an <code>M115</code> to the printer on initial connection in order to try to figure out what kind of firmware it is. For FIRMWARE_NAME values containing "repetier" (case insensitive), all Repetier-specific flags will be set on the comm layer. For FIRMWARE_NAME values containing "reprapfirmware" (also case insensitive), all RepRapFirmware-specific flags will be set on the comm layer. For now no other handling will be performed.</li>
<li>Added safe mode flag <code>--safe</code> and config setting <code>startOnceInSafeMode</code> that disables all third party plugins when active. The config setting will automatically be removed from <code>config.yaml</code> after the server has started through successfully.</li>
<li>Added <code>octoprint config</code> CLI that allows easier manipulation of config.yaml entries from the command line. Example: <code>octoprint config set --bool server.startOnceInSafeMode true</code></li>
</ul>
<h5>Improvements</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1048</a> - Added "Last print time" to extended file information (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1522</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1422</a> - Added option for post roll for timed timelapse to duplicate last frame instead of capturing new frames. That makes for a faster render at the cost of a still frame at the end of the rendered video. See also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1553</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1551</a> - Allow to define a custom bounding box for valid printer head movements in the printer profile, to make print dimension check more flexible.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1583</a> - Strip invalid <code>pip</code> arguments from <code>pip uninstall</code> commands, if provided by the user as additional pip arguments.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1593</a> - Automatically migrate old manual system commands for restarting OctoPrint and rebooting or shutting down the server to the new system wide configuration settings. Make a backup copy of the old <code>config.yaml</code> before doing so in case a manual rollback is required.</li>
<li>New central configuration option for commands to restart OctoPrint and to restart and shut down the system OctoPrint is running on. This allows plugins (like the Software Update Plugin or the Plugin Manager) and core functionality to perform these common administrative tasks without the user needing to define everything redundantly.</li>
<li><code>pip</code> helper now adjusts <code>pip install</code> parameters corresponding to detected <code>pip</code> version:<ul>
<li>Removes <code>--process-dependency-links</code> when it's not needed</li>
<li>Adds <code>--no-use-wheel</code> when it's needed</li>
<li>Detects and reports on completely broken versions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Better tracking of printer connection state for plugins and scripts:<ul>
<li>Introduced three new Events <code>Connecting</code>, <code>Disconnecting</code> and <code>PrinterStateChanged</code>.</li>
<li>Introduced new GCODE script <code>beforePrinterDisconnected</code> which will get sent before a (controlled) disconnect from the printer. This can be used to send some final commands to the printer before the connection goes down, e.g. <code>M117 Bye from OctoPrint</code>.</li>
<li>The communication layer will now wait for the send queue to be fully processed before disconnecting from the printer for good. This way it is ensured that the <code>beforePrinterDisconnected</code> script or any further GCODE injected into it will actually get sent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additional baud rates to allow for connecting can now be specified along side additional serial ports via the settings dialog and the configuration file.</li>
<li>Option to never send checksums (e.g. if the printer firmware doesn't support it), see <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#949</a>.</li>
<li>Added secondary temperature polling interval to use when printer is not printing but a target temperature is set - this way the graph should be more responsive while monitoring a manual heatup.</li>
<li>Test buttons for webcam snapshot &amp; stream URL, ffmpeg path and some other settings (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#183</a>).</li>
<li>Temperature graph automatically adjusts its Y axis range if necessary to accomodate the plotted data (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#632</a>).</li>
<li>"Fan on" command now always sends <code>S255</code> parameter for better compatibility across firmwares.</li>
<li>Warn users with a notification if a file is selected for printing that exceeds the current print volume (if the corresponding model data is available, see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1254</a>)</li>
<li>Added option to also display temperatures in Fahrenheit (see also [#1258] (https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1258))</li>
<li>Better error message when the <code>config.yaml</code> file is invalid during startup</li>
<li>API now also allows issuing absolute jogging commands to the printer</li>
<li>Printer profile editor dialog refactored to better structure fields and explain where they are used</li>
<li>Option to detect z-hops during z-based timelapses and not trigger a snapshot (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1148</a>)</li>
<li>File rename, move and copy functionality exposed via API, not yet utilized in stock frontend but available in <a href="https://github.com/Salandora/OctoPrint-FileManager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">file manager plugin</a>.</li>
<li>Try to assure a sound SSL environment for the process at all times</li>
<li>Improved caching:<ul>
<li>Main page and asset files now carry proper <code>ETag</code> and <code>Last-Modified</code> headers to allow for sensible browser-side caching</li>
<li>API sets <code>Etag</code> and/or <code>Last-Modified</code> headers on responses to GET requests where possible and feasible to allow for sensible browser-side caching</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Renamed <code>GcodeFilesViewModel</code> to <code>FilesViewModel</code> - plugin authors should accordingly update their dependencies from <code>gcodeFilesViewModel</code> to <code>filesViewModel</code>. Using the old name still works, but will log a warning and stop working with 1.4.x.</li>
<li>Make sure <code>volume.depth</code> for circular beds is forced to <code>volume.width</code> in printer profiles</li>
<li>Support for <code>M116</code></li>
<li>Support <code>M114</code> responses without whitespace between coordinates (protocol consistency - who needs it?).</li>
<li><code>M600</code> is now marked as a long running command by default.</li>
<li>Don't focus files in the file list after deleting a file - made the list too jumpy.</li>
<li>Cura plugin: "Test" button to check if path to cura engine is valid.</li>
<li>Cura plugin: Wizard component for configuring the path to the CuraEngine binary and for importing the first slicing profile</li>
<li>GCODE viewer: Added Layer Up/Down buttons (see also [#1306] (https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1306))</li>
<li>GCODE viewer: Allow cycling through layer via keyboard (up, down, pgup, pgdown)</li>
<li>GCODE viewer: Allow changing size thresholds via settings menu (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1308</a>)</li>
<li>GCODE viewer: Added support for GCODE arc commands (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1382</a>)</li>
<li>Language packs: Limit upload dialog for language pack archives to .zip, .tar.gz, .tgz and .tar extensions.</li>
<li>Plugin Manager: Adjusted to utilize new <code>pip</code> helper</li>
<li>Plugin Manager: Show restart button on install/uninstall notification if restart command is configured and a restart is required</li>
<li>Plugin Manager: Track managable vs not managable plugins</li>
<li>Plugin Manager: Allow hiding plugins from Plugin Manager via <code>config.yaml</code>.</li>
<li>Plugin Manager: Limit upload dialog for plugin archives to .zip, .tar.gz, .tgz and .tar extensions.</li>
<li>Plugin Manager: Allow closing of all notifications and close them automatically on detected server disconnect. No need to keep a "Restart needed" message around if a restart is in progress.</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: More verbose output for logged in administrators. Will now log the update commands and their output similar to the Plugin Manager install and uninstall dialog.</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: CLI for checking for and applying updates</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: Wizard component for configuring OctoPrint's update mechanism</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: "busy" spinner on check buttons while already checking for updates.</li>
<li>Software Update plugin: Prevent update notification when wizard is open.</li>
<li>Plugin Manager / Software Update plugin: The "There's a new version of pip" message during plugin installs and software updates is no longer displayed like an error.</li>
<li>Plugin Manager / Software Update plugin: The "busy" dialog can no longer be closed accidentally.</li>
<li>Timelapse: Better (&amp; earlier) reporting to the user when something's up with the snapshot URL causing issues with capturing timelapse frames and hence making it impossible to render a timelapse movie on print completion.</li>
<li>Virtual printer: Usage screen for the <code>!!DEBUG</code> commands on <code>!!DEBUG</code>, <code>!!DEBUG:help</code> or <code>!!DEBUG:?</code></li>
<li>Updated frontend dependencies (possibly relevant for plugin authors):<ul>
<li>Bootstrap to 2.3.2</li>
<li>JQuery to 2.2.4</li>
<li>Lodash to 3.10.1</li>
<li>SockJS to 1.1.1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Better error resilience against errors in UI components.</li>
<li>Various improvements in the GCODE interpreter which performs the GCODE analysis</li>
<li>Various adjustments towards Python 3 compatibility (still a work in progress though, see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1411</a>, <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1412</a>, <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1413</a>, <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1414</a>)</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1599</a> - Properly handle exceptions that arise within the update script during runtime.</li>
<li>It's not possible anymore to select files that are not machinecode files (e.g. GCODE) for printing on the file API.</li>
<li>Changes to a user's personal settings via the UI now propagate across sessions.</li>
<li>Improved compatibility of webcam rotation CSS across newer browsers (see also <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/pull/1436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1436</a>)</li>
<li>Fix for system menu not getting properly reloaded after entries changed</li>
<li>Invalidate <code>/api/settings</code> cache on change of the currently enabled plugins (by including plugin names into ETag calculation) and/or on change of the current effective config.</li>
<li>Fix for <code>/api/settings</code> not being properly invalidated for plugin settings that do not have a representation in <code>config.yaml</code> but are only added at runtime (and hence are not captured by <code>config.effective</code>).</li>
<li>Invalidate <code>/api/timelapse</code> cache on change of the current timelapse configuration.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing the version number not to be properly extracted from <code>sdist</code> tarballs generated under Windows.</li>
<li>Get rid of double scroll bar in printer profile editor.</li>
<li>Fixed tracking of current byte position in file being streamed from disk. Turns out that <code>self._handle.tell</code> lied to us thanks to line buffering.</li>
<li>Fixed select &amp; print not working anymore for SD files thanks to a timing issue.</li>
<li>Fixed <code>PrintFailed</code> event payload (was still missing new folder relevant data).</li>

<li>Pinned Tornado version to 4.0.2. Former version requirement was able to pull in a beta version causing issues with websockets due to a bug in <code>permessage-deflate</code> handling. The Tornado requirement needs an update, but we'll leave it at 4.0.2 for 1.3.0 since we'll need to do some migration work for compatibility with anything newer. Potentially related to <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#1523</a>.</li>
<li>Fix a rare race condition in the command line helper and the update script that could cause the code to hang due to waiting on an event that would never be set.</li>

    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

<h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license
    for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
    cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.</p>

<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are
    designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By
    contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your
    freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it
    remains free software for all its users.</p>

<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
    price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
    have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
    them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
    want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
    free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>

<p>Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
    with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
    you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
    and/or modify the software.</p>

<p>A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
    improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
    receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
    incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
    encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
    software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
    The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
    letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
    source code to the public.</p>

<p>The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
    ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
    to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
    provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
    users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
    a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
    code of the modified version.</p>

<p>An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
    published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
    a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
    released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
    this license.</p>

<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.</p>

<p>"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
    License.</p>

<p>"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
    of works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>

<p>"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
    "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.</p>

<p>To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
    in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
    exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
    earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.</p>

<p>A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
    on the Program.</p>

<p>To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
    permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
    infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
    computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
    distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
    public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>

<p>To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
    parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
    a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>

<p>An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
    feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>

<h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>

<p>The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.</p>

<p>A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.</p>

<p>The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.</p>

<p>The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.</p>

<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.</p>

<h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>

<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.</p>

<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.</p>

<h4><a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.</h4>

<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.</p>

<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.</p>

<h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
    recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>

<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
    and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>

<h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
    produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>

<ul>

    <li>a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
        it, and giving a relevant date.</li>

    <li>b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
        released under this License and any conditions added under section
        7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
        "keep intact all notices".</li>

    <li>c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
        License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
        additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
        regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
        invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.</li>

    <li>d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
        Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
        interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
        work need not make them do so.</li>

</ul>

<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
    works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
    and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
    in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
    "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
    used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
    beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
    in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
    parts of the aggregate.</p>

<h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
    in one of these ways:</p>

<ul>

    <li>a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
        Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
        customarily used for software interchange.</li>

    <li>b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
        (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
        written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
        long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
        copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
        product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
        more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
        conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
        Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.</li>

    <li>c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
        written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
        only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
        with subsection 6b.</li>

    <li>d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
        place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
        further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
        copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
        may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
        that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
        Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
        Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
        available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.</li>

    <li>e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
        you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
        charge under subsection 6d.</li>

</ul>

<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
    from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
    included in conveying the object code work.</p>

<p>A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
    tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
    product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
    of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
    is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
    commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
    the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>

<p>"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
    a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
    suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
    code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
    modification has been made.</p>

<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
    specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
    part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
    User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
    fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
    Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
    by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
    if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
    modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
    been installed in ROM).</p>

<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
    for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
    network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
    protocols for communication across the network.</p>

<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
    in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
    documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
    source code form), and must require no special password or key for
    unpacking, reading or copying.</p>

<h4><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>

<p>"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
    be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
    that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
    apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
    under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
    this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>

<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
    remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
    it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
    removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
    additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
    for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
    that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>

<ul>

    <li>a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
        terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>

    <li>b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
        Notices displayed by works containing it; or</li>

    <li>c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
        requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
        reasonable ways as different from the original version; or</li>

    <li>d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
        authors of the material; or</li>

    <li>e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
        trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or</li>

    <li>f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
        material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
        it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
        any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
        those licensors and authors.</li>

</ul>

<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
    restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
    received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
    governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction,
    you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further
    restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
    may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license
    document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such
    relicensing or conveying.</p>

<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
    must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
    additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
    where to find the applicable terms.</p>

<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
    form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
    the above requirements apply either way.</p>

<h4><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4>

<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
    provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
    modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
    this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
    paragraph of section 11).</p>

<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
    finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
    holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
    prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>

<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.</p>

<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
    licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
    this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
    reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
    material under section 10.</p>

<h4><a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</h4>

<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
    occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
    to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
    nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
    modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
    not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
    covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>

<h4><a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</h4>

<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
    receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.</p>

<p>An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
    work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
    transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
    licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
    give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
    Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
    the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>

<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
    rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
    not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
    rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
    any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
    sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>

<h4><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4>

<p>A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
    License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
    work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".</p>

<p>A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
    purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
    patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
    this License.</p>

<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
    patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
    make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
    propagate the contents of its contributor version.</p>

<p>In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
    agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
    (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
    sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
    party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
    patent against the party.</p>

<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
    and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
    to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
    publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
    then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
    license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
    covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
    in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
    country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>

<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
    arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
    covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
    receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
    or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
    you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
    work and works based on it.</p>

<p>A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
    the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
    conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
    specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
    work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
    in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>

<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
    otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.</p>

<h4><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
    excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
    License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
    not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
    the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
    License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>

<h4><a name="section13"></a>13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
    Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
    interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
    supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
    Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
    from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
    means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
    shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
    of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
    following paragraph.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission
    to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3
    of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to
    convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to
    apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is
    combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public
    License.</p>

<h4><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
    the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new
    versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
    in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
    Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero
    General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have
    the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
    numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
    Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number
    of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version
    ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
    versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that
    proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
    authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>

<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
    later version.</p>

<h4><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
    OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
    THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
    ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>

<h4><a name="section16"></a>16. Limitation of Liability.</h4>

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
    WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
    USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
    DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
    PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
    EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.</p>

<h4><a name="section17"></a>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</h4>

<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
    above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
    an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
    Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
    copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>

<p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

<h3><a name="howto"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>

<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>

<pre>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
    published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
    License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;http://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.
</pre>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>

<p>If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
    network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
    get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
    interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
    of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
    solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
    specific requirements.</p>

<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
    if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
